## My attempt at TOP Recipes project!

### By completing this project I have successfully practiced the following:
- Creating webpages using web development standard practice through the use of the HTML boilerplate
- Experimenting with various HTML tags
    - Create headers
    - Create paragraphs
    - Create links to other pages
    - Create lists (ordered and unordered)
    - Display images
- I have also practiced using git to manage my project in conjunction with GitHub

I have become more comfortable with HTML.
